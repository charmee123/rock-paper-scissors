# rock-paper-scissors

I have created a rock-paper-scissors game using html, css, javascript.
Rules of the game are very simple
=> click on one of the icons among rock, paper and scissors.
=> Rock beats Scissors.
=> Paper beats stone.
=> Scissors beats paper.
=> system will automatically update your score in the score board.
=> So let's have fun by playing rock-paper-scissors game.
